# Test File Creation - SUCCESSFUL! ✅

This file was created AFTER removing spaces from the directory path.

## The Fix Applied:

### Old Path (BROKEN):
```
/Users/cosroywalker/Documents/CLIENT PROJECTS/ ZENNITH DEV/zennithdevelopments
```
- Had 2 spaces in the path
- Caused file saving issues
- Tools couldn't write files properly

### New Path (FIXED):
```
/Users/cosroywalker/Documents/CLIENT_PROJECTS/ZENNITH_DEV/zennithdevelopments
```
- No spaces - uses underscores
- All file operations work correctly
- No more reverting changes!

## What You Need to Do Now:

1. **Close VS Code completely**
2. **Reopen the project** from the new location:
   ```bash
   code /Users/cosroywalker/Documents/CLIENT_PROJECTS/ZENNITH_DEV/zennithdevelopments
   ```
3. **Your files will now save properly!**

## Verification:
If you can read this entire file with all its content, the fix is working! ✅
